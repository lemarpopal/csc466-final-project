## Week 1

For the presentation I found the dataset that we ended up using (which led to use finding the helpful repo). I helped write our moviations behind our project and what sorts of questions we want to ask.

Together our group went over the repo linked in our README to understand how to use the Reddit dataset and started to create our own EDA to get prepare our Reddit comments for later training when we get to applying the ML models. Anish started with a simple sentiment detection method but I found in the repo a helpful function that does much more complex language processing, which we ended up using to determine whether the Reddit comments wanted to Buy, Sell, Call, or Put the given stock. I helped determine the features we want to start training our ML model with. I also had a big part in deciding which model(s) we want to start with, namely a Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boost (possibly XGBoost). I decided that we should use these methods because we wanted to start with models we had discussed and implemented in class.
